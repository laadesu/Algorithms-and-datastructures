This course covered fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their analysis. Through lectures and practical exercises, we learnt to compare algorithms, implement data structures, and design efficient programs. 
The files included here cover single and double linked lists, graphs, hash tables trees, different sorting algorithms and more.
